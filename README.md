# Quantum protein-folding on a planar lattice model with VQE
The method is from the paper https://www.nature.com/articles/srep00571, which provides the technique for mapping protein construction onto qubits and folding proteins on a planar lattice model on quantum annealing. For a detailed explanation of the approach, you can refer to the paper. My code constructed the Hamiltonian according to the paper. However, instead of using quantum annealing, I implemented the method with SapmpleVQE on Qiskit. This method required fewer qubits compared to quantum annealing.
